Each incorrect guess will bring the hangman one step closer to being complete!\n3. **Word Chain**: We take turns thinking of a word that starts with the last letter of the previous word. For example, if I say \"cat,\" you could say \"turtle\" because turtle starts with the letter \"t.\"\n4. **Would You Rather**: I'll give you two options, and you have to choose which one you prefer. For example, \"Would you rather go on a hot air balloon ride or go skydiving?\"\n5. **Two Truths and a Lie**: I'll tell you three statements, two of which are true and one of which is false. You have to guess which one is the lie.\n6. **Guess the Number**: I'll think of a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it. After each guess, I'll give you a hint, such as \"too high\" or \"too low.\"\n7. **Storytelling**: I'll start telling a story, and then stop at a cliffhanger. You can then continue the story in your own words, and I'll respond with the next part of the story.\n8. **Trivia**: I'll ask you trivia questions on a variety of topics, and you try to answer them correctly.\n9. **Word Scramble**: I'll scramble a word and you have to unscramble it.\n10. **Mad Libs**: I'll give you a story with missing words, and you have to fill them in with a specific type of word (e.g. noun, adjective, verb, etc.) to create a funny and silly story.\n\nWhich one of these games sounds interesting to you, Boss Dipta?\nuser (relevance: 0.20): what game ideas u have?\nuser (relevance: 0.13): Make Sense.
